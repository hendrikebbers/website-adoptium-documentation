# website-adoptium-documentation

This contains the new documentation for [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net). test

The documentation is based on [asciidoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/). An html documentation can be created by calling the `build.sh` script on linux or mac. To do so [asciidoctor needs to be installed](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/) on the system.
